        </h1>

        <p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
            Marshall Bruce Mathers III was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, the only child of
            <br> Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah Rae "Debbie" (née Nelson).[10][11] His mother nearly
            <br> died during her 73-hour labor with him.[12] Eminem's parents were in a band called Daddy 
            <br>Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas–Montana border before they separated. 
            <br>His father abandoned his family when Eminem was a year and a half old, 
            <br>and Eminem was raised only by his mother, Debbie, in poverty.[10] 
            <br>He wrote letters to his father, but Debbie said that they all
            <br> came back marked "return to sender".[13] His mother later had a son named Nathan "Nate"
            <br> Kane Samara.[14]
